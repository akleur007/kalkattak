I want to build a portfolio web app with next.js.
It should a top navigation bar with 3 links: home, projects and about about.
I want a design for the project page where the user can see a list of projects. Each project should have a preview image, a title, a short description and some categories.
If possible the project list should be animated, for example, the project cards can be revealed.

---------------------

Can you add a top navigation bar for the app with 3 items: home, projects and about. They should be linked to pages. Create this pages if they do not exist and insert just a title and a dummy text inside them.
The navigation items should have some fancy mouseover effects, made with framer-motion. Feel free to be creative.
